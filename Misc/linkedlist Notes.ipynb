    "Certainly! Dealing with a linked list involves several common operations. Here are simple explanations for some key operations:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Traversal:**\n",
    "   - **Description:** Visiting each node in the linked list.\n",
    "   - **Example Code:**\n",
    "     ```python\n",
    "     current = head\n",
    "     while current:\n",
    "         # Process current node\n",
    "         current = current.next\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Insertion at the Beginning:**\n",
    "   - **Description:** Adding a new node at the beginning of the linked list.\n",
    "   - **Example Code:**\n",
