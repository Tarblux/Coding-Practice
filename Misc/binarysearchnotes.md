Both `while left != right` and `while left <= right` are commonly used in binary search implementations, and the choice between them depends on the specific requirements of the binary search algorithm and the way the search space is defined.

1. **Using `while left != right`**:
   - This condition is typically used when the search space is defined as inclusive on the left and exclusive on the right. In other words, the range `[left, right)` includes the element at the `left` index but excludes the element at the `right` index.
   - The loop continues until the search space collapses to a single element (i.e., when `left` and `right` point to the same index), ensuring that all elements in the search space are considered.
   - This condition is commonly used in cases where the search space is defined using indices or pointers and you want to avoid the risk of an infinite loop if the search space becomes empty.

   Example:
   ```python
   while left != right:
       mid = (left + right) // 2
       if condition:
           right = mid
       else:
           left = mid + 1
   ```

2. **Using `while left <= right`**:
   - This condition is typically used when the search space is defined as inclusive on both ends. In other words, the range `[left, right]` includes both the element at the `left` index and the element at the `right` index.
   - The loop continues until the search space becomes empty (i.e., when `left` exceeds `right`), ensuring that all elements in the search space are considered.
   - This condition is commonly used in cases where the search space is defined using indices or values and you want to ensure that the loop terminates correctly when the search space is empty.

   Example:
   ```python
   while left <= right:
       mid = (left + right) // 2
       if condition:
           right = mid - 1
       else:
           left = mid + 1
   ```

In summary, both conditions can be used effectively in binary search algorithms, but the choice depends on how the search space is defined and whether you want to include or exclude the endpoints of the search space. It's essential to ensure that the loop terminates correctly and that all elements in the search space are considered during the binary search process.
