# Integers

### Introduction:

- **Numbers in Python** can be integers, floating point numbers, or complex numbers.
- They are defined as `int`, `float`, and `complex` in Python.

### Creating Numbers:

```python
# Integer
num1 = 10

# Floating point
num2 = 10.5

# Complex number
num3 = 3+5j

```

### Basic Arithmetic Operations:

- Addition (`+`), subtraction (``), multiplication (``), division (`/`).
- Modulus (`%`), exponentiation (`*`), floor division (`//`).

### Conversion Between Types:

- Python automatically converts integers to floats in mixed type operations.
- Use `int()`, `float()`, and `complex()` to explicitly convert types.

```python
# Conversion
int_to_float = float(num1)
float_to_int = int(num2)

```

### Built-in Number Functions:

- Python provides several built-in functions for working with numbers.

### Immutable Nature:

- Numbers are immutable in Python. When you change the value of a number, a new object is created.

### Math Module:

- For advanced mathematical operations, Python provides a `math` module.
