    "# Creole Linguistics: A Statistical Exploration of Jamaican Music\n",
    "\n",
    "After completing my first major research paper, I discovered a genuine passion for the research process itself. The experience of forming a hypothesis, meticulously gathering data, and using statistical models to uncover hidden truths was incredibly rewarding. It ignited a desire to apply these analytical skills to other areas I was passionate about. This led me directly to my next project: a statistical exploration of Creole languages, specifically Jamaican Patois, within the music that has been the soundtrack to my life.\n",
    "\n",
    "This project, titled **\"Creole Linguistics Analysis: An In-Depth Statistical Exploration of Creole Music,\"** aimed to move beyond simple observation and empirically analyze the linguistic composition of Dancehall, Reggae, and Afrobeat music. I wanted to quantify the usage of English versus Patois and other non-English languages to understand the unique identity of each genre.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## My Methodology: How I Turned Music into Data\n",
    "\n",
    "The first challenge was building a unique dataset from scratch. The process involved several distinct steps that transformed musical lyrics into quantifiable data for statistical analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Dataset Creation\n",
    "I randomly selected songs from curated Dancehall and Reggae playlists on Spotify to ensure a non-biased sample. The dataset included 100 songs (46 Dancehall, 44 Reggae, and 10 Afrobeat) from 54 different artists, spanning 1976 to 2023.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Lyric Extraction\n",
    "I wrote a Python script to interface with the Genius.com API, allowing me to scrape lyrics for all 100 songs and organize them for analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Linguistic Analysis in R\n",
    "Using RStudio, I split the lyrics into individual words and compared each word against the Oxford English Dictionary. Matches were classified as **English**, while non-matching words were classified as **Patois** (or **Non-English** for Afrobeat tracks).\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Visualization\n",
    "I used Google Sheets and RStudio to create bar graphs, pie charts, and word clouds to interpret the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Findings from the Analysis\n",

    "### 1. Word Count Analysis: A Tale of Two Genres\n",
    "Dancehall integrates Patois more heavily than Reggae:\n",

    "| Reggae    | **9%**      | 91%          | Only genre with songs sung exclusively in English.                          |\n",
    "\n",
    "No Dancehall song had more Patois than English, but *Sim Simma* came close. Reggae uniquely featured songs entirely in English.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Word Frequency Analysis: Which Words Dominate?\n",
    "Patois words often serve as central elements in Dancehall:\n",
    "\n",
    "| Genre     | Patois as Most-Used Word | Significance                                      |\n",
    "|-----------|--------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|\n",
    "| Dancehall | **45% of songs**         | Patois words often central to hook or chorus.    |\n",
    "| Reggae    | **18% of songs**         | Lower frequency, but still key in lyrical moments.|\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Word Cloud Analysis: Uncovering Common Ground\n",
    "Word clouds revealed shared linguistic patterns:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Dancehall & Reggae:** \"Dem\" was the most frequent Patois word.\n",
    "- **Afrobeat:** \"Dey\" was the most common non-English word.\n",
    "- **Cultural Connection:** Shared patterns highlight ties across the African diaspora.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Conclusion: Language, History, and Identity\n",
    "\n",
    "This analysis revealed significant linguistic differences between Reggae and Dancehall, likely rooted in history:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Reggae** developed during British governance, leaning more heavily on English.\n",
    "- **Dancehall** emerged post-independence, embracing Patois as a marker of cultural identity.\n",
    "\n",
    "This project enriched my understanding of Jamaican music’s evolution. Special thanks to **Dr. Tris Faulkner** and the Spanish department for their guidance and support.\n",

    "1. Start with a **rough end-to-end prototype**.\n",

    "1. **Combine this with the other project READMEs** into a single **portfolio README**?\n",
    "2. Keep **each project README separate** but add a **master index** linking them together?\n",
    "3. Or **turn all of them into blog-style articles** for your website?"
