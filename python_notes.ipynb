    "The line print('Hello, world!') means “Print out the text in the string 'Hello, world!'.” When Python executes this line, you say that Python is calling the print() function and the string value is being passed to the function. A value that is passed to a function call is an argument. Notice that the quotes are not printed to the screen. They just mark where the string begins and ends; they are not part of the string value.\n",

    "1. **Function Definition:** This is where you define the function, giving it a name and specifying its parameters (inputs) and an optional return type.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "3. **Function Body:** The body of the function consists of the code that gets executed when the function is called. It contains the instructions for performing the specific task the function is designed for.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Return Statement:** If a function is supposed to produce a result, you can use the `return` statement to send a value back to the code that called the function. This value can then be used or stored as needed.\n",
