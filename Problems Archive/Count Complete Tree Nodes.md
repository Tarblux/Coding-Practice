# Count Complete Tree Nodes
### Problem
___
Given the `root` of a **complete** binary tree, return the number of the nodes in the tree.
According to **[Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_tree#Types_of_binary_trees)**, every level, except possibly the last, is completely filled in a complete binary tree, and all nodes in the last level are as far left as possible. It can have between `1` and `2h` nodes inclusive at the last level `h`.
Design an algorithm that runs in less than `O(n)` time complexity.
**Example 1:**

```plain text
Input: root = [1,2,3,4,5,6]
Output: 6

```
**Example 2:**
```plain text
Input: root = []
Output: 0

```
**Example 3:**
```plain text
Input: root = [1]
Output: 1

```
**Constraints:**
- The number of nodes in the tree is in the range `[0, 5 * 104]`.
- `0 <= Node.val <= 5 * 104`
- The tree is guaranteed to be **complete**.
