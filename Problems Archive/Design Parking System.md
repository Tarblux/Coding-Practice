## Problem

---

Design a parking system for a parking lot. The parking lot has three kinds of parking spaces: big, medium, and small, with a fixed number of slots for each size.

Implement the `ParkingSystem` class:

- `ParkingSystem(int big, int medium, int small)` Initializes object of the `ParkingSystem` class. The number of slots for each parking space are given as part of the constructor.
- `bool addCar(int carType)` Checks whether there is a parking space of `carType` for the car that wants to get into the parking lot. `carType` can be of three kinds: big, medium, or small, which are represented by `1`, `2`, and `3` respectively. **A car can only park in a parking space of its** `carType`. If there is no space available, return `false`, else park the car in that size space and return `true`.

**Example 1:**

```
Input
["ParkingSystem", "addCar", "addCar", "addCar", "addCar"]
[[1, 1, 0], [1], [2], [3], [1]]
Output
[null, true, true, false, false]

Explanation
ParkingSystem parkingSystem = new ParkingSystem(1, 1, 0);
parkingSystem.addCar(1); // return true because there is 1 available slot for a big car
parkingSystem.addCar(2); // return true because there is 1 available slot for a medium car
parkingSystem.addCar(3); // return false because there is no available slot for a small car
parkingSystem.addCar(1); // return false because there is no available slot for a big car. It is already occupied.
```

**Constraints:**

- `0 <= big, medium, small <= 1000`
- `carType` is `1`, `2`, or `3`
- At most `1000` calls will be made to `addCar`

## My Solutions

---

```python
class ParkingSystem:

    def __init__(self, big: int, medium: int, small: int):

        self.cars = {
            1 : big ,
            2 : medium ,
            3 : small
        }

    def addCar(self, carType: int) -> bool:

        if self.cars[carType] != 0 : 

            self.cars[carType] -= 1

            return True

        return False
```

Sanya ( More scalable than mine )

```python
class ParkingSystem:

    def __init__(self, big: int, medium: int, small: int):
        self.capacity = {
            1: big,
            2: medium,
            3: small,  
        }

        self.taken = {
            1: 0,
            2: 0,
            3: 0,
        } 
        

    def addCar(self, carType: int) -> bool:
        if self.capacity[carType] > self.taken[carType]:
            self.taken[carType] += 1
            return True
        return False
        

# Your ParkingSystem object will be instantiated and called as such:
# obj = ParkingSystem(big, medium, small)
# param_1 = obj.addCar(carType)
```
