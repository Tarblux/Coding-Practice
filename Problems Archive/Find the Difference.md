## Problem

---

You are given two strings `s` and `t`.

String `t` is generated by random shuffling string `s` and then add one more letter at a random position.

Return the letter that was added to `t`.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: s = "abcd", t = "abcde"
Output: "e"
Explanation: 'e' is the letter that was added.

```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: s = "", t = "y"
Output: "y"

```

**Constraints:**

- `0 <= s.length <= 1000`
- `t.length == s.length + 1`
- `s` and `t` consist of lowercase English letters.

## My Solutions

```python
class Solution:
    def findTheDifference(self, s: str, t: str) -> str:

        if not s : 

            return t

        dict = {}

        output = ''

        for i in range(0,len(s)) : 

            if s[i] not in dict : 

                dict[s[i]] = 1

            else :

                dict[s[i]] += 1

        for i in range(0,len(t)) :

            if t[i] not in dict :

                return t[i]

            else : 

                dict[t[i]] -= 1

        print(dict)

        for key in dict.keys() : 

            if dict[key] != 0 : 

                output = key

        return output
```

This doesnâ€™t work. Future self make sure you know why cuz current self is clueless

```python
class Solution:
    def findTheDifference(self, s: str, t: str) -> str:

        if not s : 

            return t

        dict = {}

        merge = s + t

        output = ''

        for i in range(0,len(merge)) : 

            if merge[i] not in dict : 

                dict[merge[i]] = 1

            else :

                dict[merge[i]] -= 1

        print(dict)

        for key in dict.keys() : 

            if dict[key] != 0 : 

                output = key

        return output
```

## Optimal Solutions

---

The optimal solution to LeetCode problem 389, "Find the Difference," involves using a data structure to keep track of character counts or using bit-wise operations for a more efficient solution. The problem asks to find one additional character that is in string `t` but not in string `s`.

### Solution 1: Using a Counter (Hash Map)

You can count the occurrences of each character in both strings and find the character that has an additional count in `t`.

### Python Implementation:

```python
class Solution:
    def findTheDifference(self, s: str, t: str) -> str:
        count = collections.Counter(s)

        for char in t:
            if count[char] == 0:
                return char
            count[char] -= 1

```

### Complexity Analysis:

- **Time Complexity**: O(n), where n is the length of the string `t`.
- **Space Complexity**: O(1) or O(n), depending on the implementation of the hash map. Typically, O(1) as the number of distinct characters is constant and limited (for example, 26 lowercase English letters).

### Solution 2: Using Bit Manipulation (XOR)

An elegant and efficient solution involves using XOR bit-wise operation. XORing all the characters in both `s` and `t` will leave us with the extra character. This works because XORing a number with itself results in 0, and XOR is commutative and associative.

### Python Implementation:

```python
class Solution:
    def findTheDifference(self, s: str, t: str) -> str:
        diff = 0
        for char in s:
            diff ^= ord(char)
        for char in t:
            diff ^= ord(char)
        return chr(diff)

```

### Complexity Analysis:

- **Time Complexity**: O(n), where n is the length of the string `t`.
- **Space Complexity**: O(1), as it uses a constant amount of extra space.

Both methods are optimal, but the XOR approach is particularly elegant and efficient, as it leverages the properties of bit-wise operations to solve the problem without needing additional space for character counts.
